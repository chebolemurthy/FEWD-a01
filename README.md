FEWD assignment 1

## About Me:
I'm Sri Chebole, originally from India. This is my 1st GitHub repo created using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

From quite some time I wanted to learn writing code to create websites/develop applications and other aspects of software development life cycle. I have previously completed Mobile Application Development program here with SDCCD in which I've learned a bit of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and want to further my learning by taking FEWD courses to gather web design/development knowledge.

I hope to use the skills to build my own web site/application for some of the pet project ideas I've been harnessing for a while. I'm very much into learning new things/skills.

## Leisure pursuit(s):
-	Travelling/exploring new places
-	Going to the movies
-	Hang out with friends/family.
